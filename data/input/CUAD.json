Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party's assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party's assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party's Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.\n\nSection 8.02. Divested Businesses. In the event a Party divests a line of business or line of products or services by (a) spinning off a member of its Group by its sale or other disposition to a Third Party, (b) reducing ownership or control in a member of its Group so that it no longer qualifiers as a member of its Group under this Agreement, (c) selling or otherwise transferring such line of business, products or services to a Third Party or (d) forming a joint venture with a Third Party with respect to such line of business, products or services (each such divested entity or line of business, products or services, a \"Divested Entity\"), the Divested Entity 12\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nshall retain those licenses granted to it under this Agreement, provided that the license shall be limited to the business, products or services (as applicable) of the Divested Entity as of the date of divestment and such natural development thereof within the Nuance Field of Use (where Nuance is the divesting Party) or SpinCo Field of Use (where SpinCo is the divesting party). The retention of any license grants are subject to the Divested Entity's and, in the event it is acquired by a Third Party, such Third Party's execution and delivery to the non-transferring Party, within 90 days of the effective date of such divestment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event will the licenses retained by a Divested Entity extend to products, services or other activities of a Third Party acquirer existing on or before the date of the divestment, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such divestment, and (ii) in the event that a Divested Entity owns any Intellectual Property Rights licensed to the other Party under this Agreement, such Intellectual Property Rights may be transferred or assignment with such Divested Entity subject to the terms and conditions this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE IX TERMINATION\n\nSection 9.01. Termination by Both Parties. Subject to Section 9.02, this Agreement may not be terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of each of the Parties.\n\nSection 9.02. Termination prior to the Distribution. This Agreement may be terminated by Nuance at any time, in its sole discretion, prior to the Distribution; provided, however, that this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Separation Agreement in accordance with its terms.\n\nSection 9.03. Effect of Termination; Survival. In the event of any termination of this Agreement prior to the Distribution, neither Party (nor any member of their Group or any of their respective directors or officers) shall have any Liability or further obligation to the other Party or any member of its Group under this Agreement. Except with respect to termination of the Agreement under Section 9.02, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, ARTICLE I, ARTICLE VI, ARTICLE VII, this Section 9.03 and ARTICLE XI shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE X FURTHER ASSURANCES\n\nSection 10.01. Further Assurances.\n\n(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and agreements to consummate, and make effective, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n(b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Distribution Date, each Party shall cooperate with the other Party, without any further 13\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nconsideration, but at the expense of the requesting Party: (i) to execute and deliver, or use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including any instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer as such Party may reasonably be requested to execute and deliver by the other Party; (ii) to make, or cause to be made, all filings with, and to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all Consents of any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any permit, license, Contract, indenture or other instrument; and (iii) to take, or cause to be taken, all such other actions as such Party may reasonably be requested to take by the other Party from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and any transfers of Intellectual Property Rights or assignments and assumptions of Liabilities related thereto as set forth in the Separation Agreement.\n\nARTICLE XI MISCELLANEOUS\n\nSection 11.01. Counterparts; Entire Agreement; Corporate Power.\n\n(a) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which counterparts shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to the other Party. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or PDF signature and scanned and exchanged by electronic mail, and such facsimile or PDF signature or scanned and exchanged copies shall constitute an original for all purposes.\n\n(b) This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto contain the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous agreements, negotiations, discussions, writings, understandings, commitments and conversations with respect to such subject matter, and there are no agreements or understandings between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof other than those set forth or referred to herein or therein. In the event of conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.\n\n(c) Nuance represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the Nuance Group, and SpinCo represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the SpinCo Group, as follows:\n\n(i) each such Person has the requisite corporate or other power and authority and has taken all corporate or other action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and\n\n(ii) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by it and constitutes, or will constitute, a valid and binding agreement of it enforceable in accordance with the terms thereof.\n\nSection 11.02. Dispute Resolution. In the event that either Party, acting reasonably, forms the view that another Party has caused a material breach of the terms of this Agreement, then the Party that forms such a view shall serve written notice of the alleged breach on the other Parties and the Parties shall work together in good faith to resolve any such alleged 14\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nbreach within thirty (30) days of such notice (a \"Dispute\"). If any such alleged breach is not so resolved, then a senior executive of each Party shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such alleged breach within the following thirty (30) days of the referral of the matter to the senior executives. If no resolution is reached with respect to any such alleged breach in accordance with the procedures contained in this Section 11.02, then the Parties may seek to resolve such matter in accordance with Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06\n\nSection 11.03. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. Any disputes relating to, arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including to its execution, performance, or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. Each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) over any and all claims, disputes, controversies or disagreements between the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including their execution, performance or enforcement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert, and shall hereby waive, any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any legal proceeding resolved in accordance with this Section 11.03, Section 11.04, Section 11.05 and Section 11.06 shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.\n\nSection 11.04. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THEIR EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. THIS SECTION HAS BEEN FULLY DISCUSSED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES AND THESE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY EXCEPTIONS.\n\nSection 11.05. Court-Ordered Interim Relief. In accordance with Section 11.03 and Section 11.04, at any time after giving notice of a Dispute, each Party shall be entitled to interim measures of protection duly granted by a court of competent jurisdiction: (1) to preserve the status quo pending resolution of the Dispute; (2) to prevent the destruction or loss of documents and other information or things relating to the Dispute; or (3) to prevent the transfer, disposition or hiding of assets. Any such interim measure (or a request therefor to a court of competent jurisdiction) shall not be deemed incompatible with the provisions of Section 11.02, Section 11.03 and Section 11.04. Until such Dispute is resolved in accordance with Section 11.02 or final judgment is rendered in accordance with Section 11.03 and Section 11.04, each 15\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nParty agrees that such Party shall continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement and that such obligations shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination.\n\nSection 11.06. Specific Performance. Subject to Section 11.02 and Section 11.05, in the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, the affected Party shall have the right to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief of its rights under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at Law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. The other Party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond or similar security with such remedy are waived.\n\nSection 11.07. Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or as otherwise may be provided in the Separation Agreement with respect to the rights of any Nuance Indemnitee or SpinCo Indemnitee, in his, her or its respective capacities as such, (a) the provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Parties hereto and are not intended to confer upon any Person except the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder and (b) there are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and this Agreement shall not provide any third person with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right in excess of those existing without reference to this Agreement.\n\nSection 11.08. Notices. All notices or other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be duly given (a) when delivered in person, (b) on the date received, if sent by a nationally recognized delivery or courier service, (c) upon written confirmation of receipt after transmittal by electronic mail or (d) upon the earlier of confirmed receipt or the fifth (5t h) business day following the date of mailing if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid and addressed as follows:\n\nIf to Nuance, to:\n\nNuance Communications, Inc. 1 Wayside Road, Burlington, MA 01803 Attn: Wendy Cassity, EVP and Chief Legal Officer email: Wendy.cassity@nuance.com with a copy to: David Garfinkel, SVP Corporate Development email: David.garfinkel@nuance.com\n\nand\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP 1285 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10019-6064 Attn: Scott A.

Import and Export Control. Each Party agrees that it shall comply with all applicable national and international laws and regulations relating to import and/or export control in its country(ies), if any, involving any commodities, software, services or technology within the scope of this Agreement.\n\nSection 11.10. Bankruptcy. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all rights and licenses granted by the other under or pursuant to this Agreement are, and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"), licenses of rights to \"intellectual property\" as defined under Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Nuance and the members of the Nuance Group and SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group, as licensees of such intellectual property rights under this Agreement, shall retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the Bankruptcy Code (including Nuance's and the Nuance Group members' and SpinCo's and the SpinCo Group members' right 17\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nto the continued enjoyment of the rights and licenses respectively granted by under this Agreement).\n\nSection 11.11. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances, or in jurisdictions other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be deemed replaced by a provision that such court determines is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision.\n\nSection 11.12. Expenses. Except as set forth on Schedule XXIV to the Separation Agreement, as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, (i) all third-party fees, costs and expenses incurred by either the Nuance Group or the SpinCo Group in connection with effecting the Spin-Off prior to or on the Distribution Date, whether payable prior to, on or following the Distribution Date (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any financing fees or interest payable in respect of any indebtedness incurred by SpinCo in connection with the Spin-Off), will be borne and paid by Nuance and (ii) all third-party fees, costs and expenses incurred by either the Nuance Group or the SpinCo Group in connection with effecting the Spin-Off following the Distribution Date, whether payable prior to, on or following the Distribution Date, will be borne and paid by the Party incurring such fee, cost or expense. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 11.12 shall not affect each Party's responsibility to indemnify Nuance Liabilities or SpinCo Liabilities, as applicable, arising from the transactions contemplated by the Distribution.\n\nSection 11.13. Headings. The article, section and paragraph headings contained in this Agreement, including in the table of contents of this Agreement, are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n\nSection 11.14. Survival of Covenants. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the covenants in this Agreement and the Liabilities for the breach of any obligations in this Agreement shall survive the Spin-Off and shall remain in full force and effect.\n\nSection 11.15. Waivers of Default. No failure or delay of any Party (or the applicable member of its Group) in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. Waiver by any Party of any default by the other Party of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default.\n\nSection 11.16. Amendments. No provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed waived, amended, supplemented or modified by any Party, unless such waiver, amendment, 18\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nsupplement or modification is in writing and signed by the authorized representative of each Party.\n\nSection 11.17. Interpretation. Words in the singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires. The terms \"hereof,\" \"herein,\" \"herewith\" and words of similar import, unless otherwise stated, shall be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including all of the schedules hereto) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Article, Section or Schedule references are to the articles, sections and schedules of or to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule to this Agreement but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement. Any definition of or reference to any agreement, instrument or other document herein (including any reference herein to this Agreement) shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed as referring to such agreement, instrument or other document as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (subject to any restrictions on such amendments, supplements or modifications set forth therein, including in Section 11.16 above). The word \"including\" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall mean \"including, without limitation,\" unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified. The word \"or\" shall not be exclusive. The word \"extent\" in the phrase \"to the extent\" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply \"if.\" All references to \"$\" or dollar amounts are to the lawful currency of the United States of America. In the event that an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions hereof.\n\n[SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW] 19\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Intellectual Property Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives.

                    "context": "Exhibit 10.8 Affiliate Program / Premium Affiliate Management General Terms and Conditions\n\nThe following General Terms and Conditions are intended for (i) Web site owners (hereafter, \"Affiliates\") who wish to participate as Affiliates in the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 (governed by II. and IV. in these General Terms and Conditions) on the basis of these General Terms and Conditions and also for (ii) Software Publishers who distribute their software products as downloads using the services of element 5 GmbH, Vogelsanger Strasse 78, 50823 Cologne, Germany and its subsidiaries (together hereafter, \"element 5\") and who wish to make use of the additional service provided by element 5 (hereafter, \"Affiliate Management\", governed under III. and IV. in these General Terms and Conditions) for integration of the Affiliate Program provided by element 5.\n\nI. Object of the Affiliate Program/ Affiliate Management Program for Software Publishers\n\nThe object of the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 (hereafter, \"Program\") is to publish electronic advertisements on the Web site of the Affiliate for selected software products offered by element 5 Software Publishers. Instead of fixed compensation, the Affiliate receives result- dependent Advertising Cost Compensation (also known in the element 5 Control Panel as \"Commission\") in exchange for publishing the advertisements. The Advertising Cost Compensation depends on the actual sales generated by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the Affiliate's link).\n\nWithin the context of sales processed from this Program, element 5 acts (to the end user) as a service provider for Software Publisher and handles the sales process by proxy of Software Publisher in accordance with underlying share-it! Developer Agreement. element 5 receives an additional service fee from the participating Publishers for this Affiliate Management.\n\nUnder the terms of this Affiliate Management, \"Software Publisher's Control Panel\" shall mean the password protected secure interface on element 5's Web servers that allows the Software Publisher to gain access to Sales data and End User data through a secure online connection and change Software Publisher related settings, e.g. the commission of the Affiliate and activation and deactivation of the Affiliate.\n\n\"Affiliate's Control Panel\" shall mean the password protected secure interface on element 5's Web servers that allows the Affiliate to (i) gain access to referred sales through a secure online connection and (ii) change Affiliate related settings, e.g. input or alteration of personal data, definition of default style within the context of the given technical limitations, and requests for new partnerships with Software Publishers or termination of existing partnerships.\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Affiliate Program\n\n\u00a7 1 Affiliate Participation\n\nParticipation of an individual Affiliate in the Program is dependent on activation by the Software Publisher. Once the Affiliate has registered, element 5 will send an e-mail to Software Publisher with a request to activate the Affiliate. Once the Affiliate is activated by the Software Publisher, the Affiliate is considered to be a participant in this program and is bound by these General Terms and Conditions.\n\n\u00a7 2 Products under the Agreement\n\n(1) The Products under the Agreement are software products designated by the respective Software Publisher for this purpose and which can be selected by the Affiliate from a product catalog in the Affiliate Control Panel. (2) Following initial activation of a product under the agreement, the Affiliate has the opportunity to choose further software products (including those from other Software Publishers), found in the Affiliate's Control Panel, and offer them on the Affiliate's Web site under these General Terms and Conditions. However, the offering of these new products is dependent on the Software Publisher activating the Affiliate for the respective software.\n\n\u00a7 3 Control Panel\n\n(1) After successfully completing the registration process for participation in the Program, the Affiliate will be sent a user ID and a password to access to the \"Affiliate Control Panel\". With the user ID and password, the \"Affiliate Control Panel\" provides the Affiliate access, via a secure online connection, to a secure area on element 5's Web server so that the Affiliate may, at any time, view the number of software sales the Affiliate has referred, as well as change other settings. (2) When using the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall observe the following obligations and precautions: (i) Only the Affiliate may use the user ID and password. (ii) The password shall be kept strictly confidential. The Affiliate shall take due care to ensure that no unauthorized parties learn the password. (iii) If the Affiliate loses its password or if there is a possibility that an unauthorized party has learned the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall immediately report this to element 5, which can then block access by the Affiliate to the Control Panel. All actions carried out with the user ID and password will be attributed to the Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 4 Integration of the Link\n\n(1) The Affiliate shall integrate the product under the agreement using the appropriate link on its Web site; the link points to the order form operated by element 5. This link is generated by a Link Generator for the respective product under the agreement. The Link\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator is located in the secure area of element 5's Web site in the \"Affiliate Control Panel\". The link that is generated contains an individualized affiliate user ID by means of which any sales can be attributed to the Affiliate. Proper technical integration of the link is the responsibility of the Affiliate. If the links do not function, no Advertising Cost Compensation will be paid. (2) The Affiliate shall indicate on its Web site that (i) the Affiliate is acting as an independent partner of the respective Software Publisher by participation in the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 and (ii) The Software Publisher is the seller of the product and the payment process is administered by element 5. (3) The Affiliate shall produce a brief description for each activated product on its Web site. The Affiliate is responsible for the content, the style and the layout of this information. The Software Publisher can provide the Affiliate with graphics and text in an electronic format for use in describing the product, which the Affiliate shall use for the purpose of advertising the Products under the Agreement and links according to the instructions of the Software Publisher. The Affiliate should be aware that the product prices and availability may change at any time. It is not recommended that the price be listed on the Web site of the Affiliate. Maintenance of these product prices is possible only on the Web sites of the Software Publisher and the Publisher's corresponding site operated by element 5.\n\n\u00a7 5 Order Processing\n\n(1) element 5 shall be responsible for the entire order processing for the referred end user according to the terms and conditions of the underlying share-it! Developer Agreement between the Software Publisher and element 5. element 5 shall provide the order forms for the order processing on its Web server; receive payments from the referred end users and forward these payments, less the agreed Advertising Cost Compensation, the service fees and relevant value added tax (VAT) to the Software Publisher; handle refunds and returns according to the provisions of the underlying share-it! Developer Agreement; and provide end user service relating to the administration of the order. The Software Publisher shall provide technical end-user service. (2) element 5 reserves the right to reject queries and orders which do not meet its requirements; including, in particular, orders by referred end users who do not meet credit requirements, who do not authorize direct debiting from their bank account, or who do not present a valid credit card. (3) An agreement by the Software Publisher with the referred end user does not exist until either a written or electronic order confirmation arrives from element 5 in the name of the Software Publisher or when element 5 begins to fulfill the agreement in the name of the Software Publisher. Typographical, printing and computation errors on the Web site of the Affiliate shall be charged to said Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 6 Advertising Cost Compensation\n\n(1) element 5 will pay Affiliate its advertising costs (including Vat, if any, on presentation of a valid VAT invoice) if an end user arrives via the link integrated in Affiliate's Web site at the order page hosted by element 5 for the respective Software\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nPublisher's Product under this Agreement and end user uses the automatic ordering system that carries out the registration and payment processing, so that the Affiliate's link is deemed to be directly causative for the entry of the End User into the agreement with the Software Publisher and End User's payment, proving that all requirements are irrevocably met (\"agreements arising in a qualified manner\"). Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned. (2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher via integrated link. (3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the effective gross sales price of the software. (5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.\n\nIII. Affiliate Management for Software Publishers\n\n\u00a7 1 Participation by the Software Publisher\n\n(1) Software Publisher's participation in Affiliate Management indicates that the Software Publisher agrees to these General Terms and Conditions, and that the Software Publisher shall integrate the Affiliate Program into the Web site using a corresponding link. (2) To generate revenue through this Program by means of sales referred by the Affiliate, the Affiliate, after completion of registration, must be activated by the Software Publisher in the Control Panel. The Software Publisher will be informed of the Affiliate's\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nregistration per e-mail with a request for the Affiliate's activation from element 5. (3) By configuring the settings in the Control Panel, the Software Publisher determines the amount of the success-based Advertising Cost Compensation. If the Publisher does not configure any settings, then it will accept the default settings proposed by element 5 when activating the Affiliate. Prior to making changes in the Control Panel regarding the amount of the Advertising Cost Compensation, written notification must be given to element 5 and the Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 2 Integration of the link\n\n(1) element 5 shall make a hyperlink available to the Software Publisher that links to the appropriate registration form for the Affiliate Program. The link can be accessed in the secure \"Software Publisher Control Panel\" on element 5's Web site under \"Affiliate Management\". (2) Every Affiliate must complete the registration form once prior to participating in the Program and agree to these General Terms and Conditions by checking the Online checkbox. Afterwards, the Affiliate can also advertise other Products under this Agreement (see above \u00a7 3) after activation by the respective Software Publisher.\n\n\u00a7 3 element 5's Service Fee\n\nFor each sale administered by element 5 of the Software under this Agreement, element 5 shall receive an additional service fee of 2% of the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) as well as the Advertising Cost Compensation defined in II. \u00a7 6 (4) and in addition to VAT or sales tax (where applicable). element 5 will pay the Affiliate the Advertising Cost Compensation as defined in II. \u00a7 6 . Further invoicing terms are obtained from the existing business relationship, defined in the respective share-it! Developer Agreement between Software Publisher and element 5.\n\nIV. General terms\n\n\u00a7 1 License\n\nUpon activation of the Affiliate, the Software Publisher grants the Affiliate a non-exclusive, revocable right to use provided advertising material, notices and all further presentations (insofar as available - also known hereafter as \"Material\") only for the purpose of designating its Web site as a \"partner Web site\" and presenting the designated advertising Material.

Naked hereby engages Wade for collaboration in business development for, and his endorsement as set forth herein of, the following items, which shall be known herein as \"Innerwear\": Briefs, trunks, boxer briefs and boxers, non-athletic undershirts (i.e., t-shirts intended to be worn as innerwear and not intended specifically for athletic purposes), non-athletic lounge apparel (bottoms and tops), sleepwear (including pajama bottoms and tops), and robes (as may be expanded to include other mutually agreed upon innerwear and lounge apparel) which may now or hereafter during the Term be manufactured, distributed, marketed and/or sold by Naked (collectively, the \"Naked Products\"), and Wade hereby accepts such engagement. The Parties agree that the territory of such engagement shall be worldwide (the \"Territory\").\n\n2. Term of Agreement. The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period of four (4) years, commencing on the Effective Date, which term may be extended for up to three (3) years by written agreement of both Parties prior to the expiration date of the initial term or any extension thereof (collectively, the \"Term\"). Each twelve-month period beginning on the Effective Date shall be known as a \"Contract Year.\" In the event that either Wade or Naked wishes to extend the Term of the Agreement as contemplated above, it shall provide the other Party with written notice at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term. The other Party will then have a period of fourteen (14) days from the date of the notice to indicate whether it also desires to extend the Term, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and if no such indication is made, the other Party will be deemed to have declined the offer to extend. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wade agrees that for a period of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term (unless the Agreement is terminated by Wade as permitted hereunder), Naked shall have the exclusive right to negotiate for continued endorsement by Athlete of the Naked Products. For a period of six (6) months at the end of the Term (the \"Sell-off Period\"); provided that the Agreement was not terminated by Wade as permitted herein, Naked will have the right to continue to sell the Wade Products (defined below) for which orders have already been placed at the end of the Term on the terms and conditions herein.\n\n3.

Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to this omitted information pursuant to an application for confidential treatment filed with  the Commission under Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n(1) On Naked's website(s) (\"Website\");\n\n(2) In social media channels, including, but not limited to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Google+, Tumblr and other mutually agreeable channels, with reasonable frequency, to promote Naked Products and Wade Products;\n\n(3) In marketing and media opportunities in connection with the Wade Services (as defined below); and\n\n(4) For use on the packaging of the Naked Products and Wade Products and on Wade Products themselves.\n\nAll uses of Wade Image in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the prior written approval of Wade, which Wade shall not unreasonably withhold. Naked agrees to submit to Wade or its authorized agent a copy of all new promotional and/or advertising material using Wade Image at least ten (10) days prior to the release to the general public. Wade and its authorized agent agree that they shall not unreasonably withhold such approval. In the absence of disapproval within three (3) business days of Wade's or  authorized agent's receipt of a request for approval, said advertising or promotional material shall be deemed approved. Any such usage featuring Athlete shall be and remain the property of Naked except as otherwise set forth herein; however, Naked shall have the right to such use only during the Term. Wade may use said materials in whole or in part for Wade's personal portfolio, website or otherwise. Such usage may not be sold or transferred. For the avoidance of doubt, that certain logo designed by Athlete prior to the date hereof (the \"Logo\") shall remain the sole property of Wade and Naked shall have license during the Term to use the Logo for the advertising, endorsement, promotion, or sale of the Naked Products (including the Wade Products) in the Territory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement. During the Sell-off Period, Naked shall have the license to use the Logo solely on packaging and presentation of Wade Products already offered for sale at retail outlets or on-line in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.\n\nWade will allow Naked to use any quotes that are attributed to Wade to promote the Naked Products and Wade Products in any advertising campaign. Wade will allow Naked to use any such attributed quotes that Naked  requires to promote the Naked Products and Wade Products, subject to Wade's right to approve such quotes in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\nThe Parties acknowledge and agree that Athlete's  accomplishments and recognition as an outstanding basketball player, individual  and fashion icon, as well as his character, fame, likeness, image and reputation are the essence of this Agreement.\n\nWade hereby warrants that he is not a party to any agreement,  contract or understanding which would prevent, limit or hider his performance of any of the obligations under this Agreement, provided that Naked acknowledges that it is aware of Athlete's obligations under his existing endorsement agreement with Li Ning for athletic shoes and athletic apparel and nothing  herein shall obligate Athlete to endorse any athletic apparel other than Li Ning's.\n\n2\n\nSource: NAKED BRAND GROUP INC., POS AM (on S-1), 7/31/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Information has been omitted in places marked \"[***]\" and has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Furthermore, Wade will not engage in any business or other transaction or have any financial or personal interest in any entity whose primary or core business is selling or  manufacturing Innerwear during the Term.

Further, subject to Section 17(c), neither Party shall not be liable to the other Party for any lost revenue, lost profit or lost savings. (b) Limitation of Direct Damages Subject to Section 17(c), in no event shall either Party's liability under this Agreement exceed the aggregate of all amounts paid under this Agreement and amounts that have accrued but not yet been paid in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.\n\n23.\n\nSource: EHAVE, INC., 20-F, 5/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Exceptions to Limitations Notwithstanding Sections 17(a) and 17(b), neither Party excludes or limits any liability for: (i) personal injury or death to the extent that such injury or death results from the negligence or wilful misconduct of a Party or its employees or subcontractors; (ii) fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment; (iii) the Party's obligations set out in Sections 2(c), 5(b), 5(c), 6(b), 11, 13 or 16; (iv) CHT's payment obligations under Section 7; or (v) willful misconduct or gross negligence.

FORCE MAJEURE Except for any obligation to make payments, any delay or failure of either Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or under any Schedule attached hereto shall be excused if, and to the extent, that the delay or failure is caused by an event or occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Party and without its fault or negligence and that could not have been prevented or avoided by the exercise of reasonable due diligence, such as, by way of example and not by way of limitation, acts of God, action by any Governmental Authority (whether valid or invalid), fires, flood, wind storms, explosions, riots, natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, sabotage, labour problems (including lock-outs, strikes and slow downs, except for any labour problems of the Party claiming a force majeure event), or court order or injunction; provided that written notice of delay (including anticipated duration of the delay) shall be given by the affected Party to the other Party within two (2) Business Days of the affected Party first becoming aware of such event and the affected Party shall use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and minimize the effects of such force majeure event. In the event that the force majeure event lasts for fifteen (15) Business Days or longer, either Party shall have the option to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other without liability. 19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION (a) Discussions: Each Party agrees to utilize all reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute, whether arising during the term of this Agreement or at any time after the expiration of termination of this Agreement, which touches upon the validity, construction, meaning, performance or effect of this Agreement or the rights and liabilities of the Parties or any matter arising out of or connected with this Agreement, promptly and in an amicable and good faith manner by negotiations between the Parties.\n\n24.\n\nSource: EHAVE, INC., 20-F, 5/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Mediation: Either Party may submit a dispute to mediation by providing written notice to the other Party. In the mediation process, the Parties will try to resolve their differences voluntarily with the aid of a single, impartial mediator, who shall attempt to facilitate negotiations. The mediator shall be selected by agreement of the Parties. If the Parties cannot otherwise agree on a mediator within five (5) Business Days, a single mediator shall be designated by the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. or any successor organization (\"ADR\") at the request of a Party. Any mediator so designated must not have a conflict of interest with respect to any Party. The mediation shall be conducted as specified by the mediator and agreed upon by the Parties. The Parties agree to discuss their differences in good faith and to attempt, with the assistance of the mediator, to reach an amicable resolution of the dispute. The mediation shall be treated as a settlement discussion and therefore shall be confidential. The mediator may not testify for either Party in any later proceeding relating to the dispute. No recording or transcript shall be made of the mediation proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs and legal fees in the mediation. The Parties shall share the fees and expenses of the mediator equally.

The provisions of the Arbitration Act of Ontario, as amended, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement shall govern the arbitration process. The Parties agree to exclude the appeal provisions of the Arbitration Act, as may be amended from time to time, and in particular, section 45 thereof. The determination arising out of the arbitration process shall be final and binding upon the Parties to the arbitration. (d) Exceptions to Arbitration: The following matters shall be excluded from arbitration under this Agreement: (i) any disputes involving third Persons; (ii) breach of confidentiality by either Party; and (iii) intellectual property claims, whether initiated by third Persons or by one of the Parties to this Agreement. 20.

ExxonMobil and FCE wish to further the research and development efforts to evaluate and develop new and/or improved MCFCs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and power sources (\"Scope\"). Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing premises and mutual covenants contained herein, ExxonMobil and FCE (each a \"Party\" and collectively the \"Parties\") agree as follows:\n\nARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS\n\n1.01 Definitions. The terms appearing in this Agreement in initial capital letters, not otherwise defined in the preamble or body of this Agreement, are defined in Appendix A.\n\nARTICLE 2 - PROGRAM\n\n2.01 Program / Projects. The collaborative research and development effort will comprise one or more mutually agreed upon projects within the Scope during the Term of this Agreement (each a \"Project\" and, collectively, the \"Projects\" or the \"Program\"). The details of each Project will be described in a written, mutually agreed upon document (\"Project Description\") - a template for which is set forth in Appendix B. Each Project Description will specify the scope and content of the Project, the work to be undertaken by each Party and potential third parties, the deliverables, the timing, any payments to be made not otherwise set forth in this Agreement, and any other related objectives and expectations. When completed and signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties, each Project Description will become part of this Agreement and will be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Neither Party makes any representations as to the number, frequency, or monetary value of the Projects, except as otherwise set forth herein or in any Project Description.\n\n2.02 Subcontracting. ExxonMobil hereby consents to FCE hiring trade contractors commonly used for facility modifications and individual engineering contractors and individual staff from temporary agencies as needed to perform work pursuant to a Project Description, provided that such contractors and staff are under confidentiality and use restrictions no less restrictive than the terms and conditions set forth herein.\n\n2.03 Work Exclusivity/Independent Work. During the Term of this Agreement, FCE will not conduct any Work using Generation 1 Technology in Carbon Capture Applications or any Work using Generation 2 Technology, independently or with third parties outside this Agreement, without prior written approval from ExxonMobil. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ExxonMobil hereby grants approval for FCE solely to conduct Authorized Work using Generation 1 Technology with Authorized Third Parties for Carbon Capture Applications and any Work using Generation 2 Technology solely for Power Applications and Hydrogen Applications.\n\nPage 1 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 3 - PROGRAM GOVERNANCE\n\n3.01 Steering Committee. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties will establish a committee that will oversee technical support and provide overall supervision and administrative guidance for the Program (\"Steering Committee\" or \"SC\"), further detailed as follows -\n\n(a) Composition. Each Party will appoint in writing one or more of its employees as SC members. Each Party will have the right to change its SC members at any time by giving written notice of such change to the other Party.\n\n(b) Meetings. Meetings of the SC will be in person or by phone at a location and time agreed to in advance by the SC members.\n\n(c) Other Attendees. In addition to the attendance of SC members, with prior written notice to the other Party's SC members, each Party may also bring to any SC meeting such technical and other advisors as it may deem appropriate, provided that such advisors are employees of a Party or its Affiliates and are under written confidentiality and use restrictions at least as strict as those imposed herein. Otherwise, a Party's additional invitees may attend a SC meeting only with the other Party's advance written approval.\n\n(d) Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the SC will include, but are not limited to:\n\ni. Project Endorsement and Monitoring. The SC will review and approve each Project Description and amendment thereto prior to execution by the Parties. (However, no Project Description or amendment thereto will be effective unless and until it is executed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties.) The SC will periodically monitor the ongoing status of all Projects, and make adjustments to priorities within and between the Projects.\n\nii. Dispute Resolution. Assist the Parties in resolving any disputes.\n\n(e) Votes. Each Party only gets one vote on the SC regardless of the number of SC members it appoints. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, all decisions by the SC will be by unanimous agreement. In the absence of unanimity, ExxonMobil's SC representatives will have final decision making authority with respect to only the following decisions required by the SC: whether and where to seek patent protection and whether to maintain patent assets, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6.04 (Solicitation of Program Patents Discretionary).\n\n(f) Minutes. All decisions by the SC will be documented in agreed upon minutes distributed to SC members after the meeting.\n\n(g) No Amendment Rights. The SC may recommend but has no authority to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n(h) Costs. ExxonMobil will bear its own costs associated with participating in the SC. FCE's costs and expenses associated with its participation in the SC are included in each Project's budget as Direct Costs.\n\n3.02 Technical Managers. Each Party will appoint one manager for each Project (\"Technical Manager\"). The Technical Managers will be responsible for the coordination of all technical activities arising under such Project, and will serve as their Party's technical liaison with the SC for the Project. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing upon changing the appointments. The Technical Managers for each Project will be the primary technical contacts between the Parties for that Project. The Technical Managers for each Project will jointly:\n\n\u2022 direct the work performed under a Project in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Project Description;\n\nPage 2 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 report to the SC on the progress of technical activities conducted under the Project;\n\n\u2022 monitor and coordinate all intellectual property activities relative to each Project; and\n\n\u2022 make recommendations to the SC on proposed publications containing Program Information.\n\nUnless otherwise mutually agreed, the Technical Managers for a Project will meet in person at least once each calendar quarter during a Project at such locations as the Technical Managers agree. The Technical Managers will communicate regularly by telephone or similar means between such meetings.\n\nARTICLE 4 - DISCLOSURE, CONFIDENTIALITY AND RESTRICTED USE\n\n4.01 Program Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction. FCE will promptly disclose to ExxonMobil, in written or other tangible form, any and all Program Information including any Program Inventions. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, FCE agrees to hold Program Information in confidence, and not to disclose or make it available to any third party without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending twenty (20) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, FCE agrees to use and practice Program Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 7 (License to Program Results).\n\n4.02 Background Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction. Each Party will make available its Background Information to the other Party that it believes will be useful in carrying out work under the Program. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, each Party agrees to hold the Background Information it receives from the other Party in confidence, and to not disclose or make available the other Party's Background Information to any third party without the express prior written consent of the other Party, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending twenty (20) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of the other Party, each Party agrees to use and practice the other Party's Background Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 8 (License to Background Information and Patents).\n\n4.03 Non-Analysis of Background Samples. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, each Party agrees not to determine or have determined the composition or physical structure of any Background Sample received from the other Party, which includes unused, used and spent Background Samples or portions thereof, whether by analyzing, having analyzed, inspection, reverse engineering or otherwise.\n\n4.04 Information Handling Obligations. Each Party will endeavor to mark Confidential Information as follows:\n\n(a) Confidential Information first disclosed in tangible form or electronically will be marked by the Disclosing Party as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" or with words of similar import when provided, indicating whether the information is \"Program Information\" or \"Background Information\";\n\n(b) Confidential Information first disclosed orally or by visual display will be identified by the Disclosing Party as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" or with words of similar import at first disclosure and subsequently confirmed as confidential in a summary provided in an e-mail or other written communication delivered to the other Party within thirty (30) days after first disclosure, that references the date of the confidential disclosure indicating whether the information is \"Program Information\" or \"Background Information\"; and\n\n(c) If a Sample is sent to the other Party, the Sample will be marked by the Disclosing Party as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" or with words of similar import at the time of disclosure indicating whether the Sample is \"Program Information\" or \"Background Information\".\n\nPage 3 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe failure to appropriately mark information/materials as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" upon initial disclosure to the Receiving Party will not be considered a waiver of confidentiality. Information/materials marked as \"proprietary\" or \"confidential\" when first disclosed, without further identification of the category of confidential information, will be presumptively considered and treated as Program Information until the Disclosing Party notifies the Receiving Party otherwise in writing.\n\n4.05 Exceptions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and restricted use herein shall not apply to any information or materials to the extent the Receiving Party can establish by documentary evidence that one or more of the following exceptions apply:\n\na. the information or material was already in the Receiving Party's or its Affiliate's lawful possession (free of any confidentiality and use restrictions) and was not previously acquired directly or indirectly from the other Party under a current obligation of confidentiality;\n\nb. the information or material was already in the public domain or subsequently entered the public domain after disclosure through no fault of the Receiving Party;\n\nc. the information or material was or is hereafter furnished to the Receiving Party, or its Affiliate, on a non- confidential basis by a third party legally entitled to provide the information or material without restriction;\n\nd. the information or material was independently developed by employees or agents of the Receiving Party or its Affiliate who did not have access to relevant information provided by the Disclosing Party; and/or\n\ne. the information or material was released from the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement by the Disclosing Party's written authorization.\n\nThe later occurrence of any one of the aforementioned exceptions will not excuse any failure to adequately protect Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement prior to the existence of the exception. More specific Confidential Information will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is publicly available or in the possession of Receiving Party pursuant to one of the exceptions. Also a combination of features will not be deemed within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are publicly available or in Receiving Party's possession pursuant to one of the exceptions.\n\n4.06 Disclosure to Affiliates, Contractors, and Sub-licensees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Receiving Party may disclose a Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to its Affiliates, and said Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to their respective contractors providing services in furtherance of a Project as well as to permitted sub-licensees hereunder, provided such Affiliates, contractors, and sub-licensees have agreed to be bound by confidentiality and limited use obligations no less protective of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information than the terms contained herein. The Receiving Party will be liable to the Disclosing Party for any unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information by such Affiliates, contractors, and sub-licensees.\n\n4.07 Compelled Disclosure. In the event that a Receiving Party (or its Affiliate) is required by law, court order or rule, or government authority to disclose the Confidential Information that Receiving Party is obligated to hold in confidence pursuant to Paragraph 4.01 (Program Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction) and/or Paragraph 4.02 (Background Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction), then the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party prior to disclosure in order to enable the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order at the Disclosing Party's sole expense. In any event, the Receiving Party who is required to disclose such information will request confidential treatment of the information and only disclose the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to comply with such law, court order or rule, or government authority.\n\nPage 4 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n4.08 Disclosures in Patent Applications.

FCE will assign, and hereby assigns, to ExxonMobil ownership of Program Results.\n\n6.02 Solicitation of Program Patents. ExxonMobil will have the sole responsibility and the exclusive right to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain Program Patents pursuant to Paragraph 6.01 (Ownership of Program Results). Such right will include the right to determine if, where, and when patent applications are filed, and the scope of such patent applications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ExxonMobil shall provide FCE notice of its intent to file any patent application containing FCE's Confidential Background Information and an opportunity for FCE to review any such patent application for FCE's Confidential Background Information. If FCE does not respond within thirty (30) days from ExxonMobil seeking such consent, then ExxonMobil may proceed with such filing. The cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining any such patent applications that ExxonMobil decides to pursue and maintain, as well as the cost of maintaining any patents resulting therefrom, will be paid in full by ExxonMobil. For Program Patents, if one or more employees or other representatives of FCE are determined to be inventors, then FCE will:\n\n(i) cause its employees, contractors, and consultants to render reasonable and timely assistance to ExxonMobil and its attorneys or agents;\n\n(ii) assign, and will cause its and its Affiliates' employees, contractors, and consultants to assign, its right, title, and interest in and to such Program Patent to ExxonMobil for filing; and\n\n(iii) cause its and its Affiliate employees, contractors, and consultants, to execute any documents as may be required to effect such assignments, or file, prosecute, and maintain any patent applications or patents that are based on, derived from, or protect such Program Patent.\n\nExxonMobil will hold formal legal title to all such patent applications, and resulting patents.\n\n6.03 Cooperation in Soliciting Program Patents. The Parties agree to cooperate in the preparation, filing, prosecution, and securing of patent applications and patents, all without charge to such other Party. When ExxonMobil's patent counsel sends to FCE documents for review that contains FCE Confidential Background Information, the Parties will follow the review process pursuant to Paragraph 6.02 (Solicitation of Program Patents). Upon FCE's written request, ExxonMobil will provide a courtesy copy of any Program Patent that does not contain any FCE Confidential Background Information prior to filing such document. All Program Patent filings, and the status thereof, will be reported to the Steering Committee.\n\nPage 6 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n6.04 Solicitation of Program Patents Discretionary. ExxonMobil has the unencumbered right to file or not to file, prosecute, defend, maintain, abandon, or enforce any Program Invention or Program Patent.

Within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Term of the Agreement, FCE will issue an invoice (\"9th Inning Invoice\") for the actual charges incurred during the last month of the Term of the Agreement, subject to Paragraph 10.01(a). FCE will apply any balance of the Initial Payment remaining after the 8th Inning Invoice as a credit towards the amount due on the 9th Inning Invoice. If after applying such credit, a balance of the Initial Payment still remains, FCE will refund the balance to ExxonMobil within thirty (30) days, unless otherwise mutually agreed (such as the Parties mutually agreeing to enter into a new Project and apply the balance as a credit towards amounts payable by ExxonMobil thereunder).\n\ne) Maximum Charges. The invoices sent by FCE under the foregoing procedure for each year of the Agreement may not in the aggregate be more than half the Total Research Cost, without prior written consent of ExxonMobil or amendment to the Project Description.

SECTION 1. SERVICES AS UNDERWRITER Section 1.1 Integrity will act as principal underwriter for the distribution of the Shares covered by the registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information then in effect of the Fund (the \"Registration Statement\") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"1933 Act\"), and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"). Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore. Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund's Registration Statement. Section 1.4 Integrity will provide one or more persons during normal business hours to respond to telephone questions concerning the Fund. Section 1.5 Integrity acknowledges that, whenever in the judgment of the Fund's officers such action is warranted for any reason, including, without limitation, market, economic, or political conditions, those officers may decline to accept any orders for, or make any sales of, the Shares until such time as those officers deem it advisable to accept such orders and to make such sales. Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others. Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Except as may otherwise be determined by Integrity and the Fund from time to time, such commissions or concessions shall be uniform to all dealers. Shares sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers only at the public offering price(s) set forth in the Fund's then current Registration Statement. The price the Fund shall receive for all Shares purchased from the Fund shall be the net asset value used in determining the public offering price applicable to the sale of such Shares.\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the \"Plan\") adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan. Section 1.8 Integrity will bear all expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, \"distribution expenses\" of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and 2\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares. Distribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates, or any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement. Section 1.9 Integrity shall prepare and deliver reports to the Treasurer of the Fund and to the Investment Adviser on a regular, at least quarterly, basis, showing the distribution expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan and the purposes therefore, as well as any supplemental reports as the Trustees, from time to time, may reasonably request. SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE FUND Section 2.1 The Fund agrees at its own expense to execute any and all documents, to furnish any and all information, and to take any other actions that may be reasonably necessary in connection with the qualification of the Shares for sale in those states that Integrity may designate. Section 2.2 The Fund shall furnish from time to time, for use in connection with the sale of the Shares, such information reports with respect to the Fund and its Shares as Integrity may reasonably request, all of which shall be signed by one or more of the Fund's duly authorized officers; and the Fund warrants that the statements contained in any such reports, when so signed by one or more of the Fund's officers, shall be true and correct. The Fund shall also furnish Integrity upon request with: (a) annual audits of the Fund's books and accounts made by independent public accountants regularly retained by the Fund, (b) semi-annual unaudited financial statements pertaining to the Fund, (c) quarterly earnings statements prepared by the Fund, (d) a monthly itemized list of the securities in the portfolio of the Fund, (e) monthly balance sheets as soon as practicable after the end of each month, and (f) from time to time such additional information regarding the Fund's financial condition as Integrity may reasonably request. Section 2.3 The Fund shall pay to Integrity, as set forth in the Registration Statement, any distribution and service fee authorized by the Plan. SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Section 3.1 The Fund represents to Integrity that all registration statements, prospectuses, and statements of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act with respect to the Shares of the Fund have been carefully prepared in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. As used in this Agreement, the terms \"registration statement,\" \"prospectus,\" and \"statement of additional information\" shall mean any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares. Integrity may, but shall not be obligated to, propose from time to time such amendment or amendments to any registration statement and such supplement or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information as, in the light of future developments, may, in the opinion of Integrity's counsel, be necessary or advisable. If the Fund shall not propose such amendment or amendments and/or supplement or supplements within fifteen days after receipt by the Fund of a written request from Integrity to do so, Integrity may, at its option, terminate this Agreement. The Fund shall not file any amendment to any registration statement or supplement to any prospectus or statement of additional information without giving Integrity reasonable notice thereof in advance; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way limit the Fund's right to file at any time such amendments to any registration statement and/or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information, of whatever character, as the Fund may deem advisable, such right being in all respects absolute and unconditional. 3\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 4. INDEMNIFICATION Section 4.1 The Fund authorizes Integrity and any dealers with whom Integrity has entered into dealer agreements to use any prospectus or statement of additional information furnished by the Fund from time to time in connection with the sale of Shares. The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1. The Fund's indemnification agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1 and the Fund's representations and warranties in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Integrity, its officers and governors, or any controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares. This agreement of indemnity will inure exclusively to Integrity's benefit, to the benefit of its several officers and governors, and their respective estates, and to the benefit of the controlling persons and their successors. The Fund agrees to notify Integrity promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers or trustees in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 4\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Integrity agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Fund, its several officers and trustees, and any person who controls the Fund within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the costs of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) that the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, but only to the extent that such liability or expense incurred by the Fund, its officers or trustees, or such controlling person resulting from such claims or demands shall arise out of or be based upon (a) any unauthorized sales literature, advertisements, information, statements, or representations or (b) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and used in the answers to any of the items of the registration statement or in the corresponding statements made in the prospectus or statement of additional information, or shall arise out of or be based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and required to be stated in such answers or necessary to make such information not misleading. Integrity's agreement to indemnify the Fund, its officers and trustees, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon Integrity's being notified of any action brought against the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or telegram addressed to Integrity at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to Integrity by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify Integrity of any such action shall not relieve Integrity from any liability that Integrity may have to the Fund, its officers or trustees, or to such controlling person by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of Integrity's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.2. Integrity agrees to notify the Fund promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against Integrity or any of its officers or governors in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 5\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.3 In case any action shall be brought against any indemnified party under paragraph 4.1 or 4.2, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish to do so, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. If the indemnifying party opts to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than (a) reasonable costs of investigation or the furnishing of documents or witnesses and (b) all reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to such indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the indemnified party shall have concluded reasonably that representation of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them in the conduct of the defense of such action. SECTION 5. EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION Section 5.1 None of the Shares shall be offered by either Integrity or the Fund under any of the provisions of this Agreement and no orders for the purchase or sale of the Shares hereunder shall be accepted by the Fund if and so long as the effectiveness of the registration statement then in effect or any necessary amendments thereto shall be suspended under any of the provisions of the 1933 Act or if and so long as a current prospectus as required by Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act is not on file with the SEC; provided, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph 5 shall in any way restrict or have an application to or bearing upon the Fund's obligation to repurchase Shares from any shareholder in accordance with the provisions of the Fund's prospectus, statement of additional information, or declaration of trust. SECTION 6. NOTICE TO INTEGRITY Section 6.1 The Fund agrees to advise Integrity immediately in writing: 6\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) of any request by the SEC for amendments to the registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information then in effect or for additional information; (b) in the event of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information then in effect or the initiation of any proceeding for that purpose; (c) of the happening of any event that makes untrue any statement of a material fact made in the registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information then in effect or that requires the making of a change in such registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information in order to make the statement therein not misleading; and (d) of all actions of the SEC with respect to any amendment to any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information which may from time to time be filed with the SEC. SECTION 7. TERM OF AGREEMENT Section 7.1 This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods ending on January 18th of each year, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the Fund's Board of Trustees and (b) a vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Plan, in this Agreement, or any agreement related to the Plan (the \"Qualified Trustees\"), by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity. This Agreement will also terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS Section 8.1 The Fund recognizes that governors, officers, and employees of Integrity may from time to time serve as directors, officers, and employees of corporations and business trusts (including other investment companies) and that Integrity or its affiliates may enter into distribution or other agreements with such other corporations and trusts. Section 8.2 It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Fund hereunder shall not be binding upon any of the trustees, shareholders, nominees, officers, agents, or employees of the Fund, personally, but bind only the property of the Fund. The execution and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees and signed by an authorized officer of the Fund, acting as such, and neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind only the property of the Fund. 7\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8.3 This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas. Section 8.4 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original; but such counterparts shall, together, constitute only one instrument. Section 8.5 This Agreement may not be amended or modified in any manner except by both parties with the same formality as this Agreement and as may be permitted or required by the 1940 Act. Section 8.6 The captions of this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and in no way define or delimit any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or effect.

(c) Notice of Claim. In the event that an HOF Entity seeks indemnification on behalf of an HOF Entity Indemnified Person, or Constellation seeks indemnification on behalf of a Constellation Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give reasonably prompt notice to the indemnifying Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, any Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.\n\n11\n\nSource: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant (other than a Constellation Indemnified Person or HOF Entity Indemnified Person) (a \"Third Person\"), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a \"Third Person Claim\"), provided that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the persons and entities to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to discharge (and does in fact so discharge) any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the aforesaid notice of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an irrevocable election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Parties shall make available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any such Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof.

In the event that, after the construction and development of the Village has been substantially completed, the Village is not usable for a period of at least thirty (30) days as a result of the events described under this Section 6.7 and unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Term shall be extended for that period of time (after substantial completion) which the Village was not usable and the start and end dates of each period shall be adjusted to reflect the number of days (after substantial completion) in which the Village was not usable for all purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation the expiration date of the Term. 6.8 Not a Lease or License of the Village.

In the event that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both. 6.11 Press Releases. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or scheduling any press conference or conference call with media members or other third parties with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

The headings used in this Agreement are solely for convenience and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the provisions set forth herein. 6.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, and on separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 6.16 Waiver. No action, other than a notice by a Party to another Party specifically stating that such notice has the effect of waiver, shall constitute a waiver of any particular breach or default of such other Party.

No waiver of full performance by a Party shall be construed, or operate, as a waiver of any subsequent default of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement. The payment or acceptance of fees or charges for any period after a default shall not be deemed a waiver of any right or acceptance of defective performance. 6.17 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be contrary to law and unenforceable by any court of law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 6.18 Third Party Beneficiaries.

The parties wish to produce a series of recorded compilations and companion song books featuring praise and worship repertoires, which will be co-branded and co-marketed throughout the world. Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       Product Concept and Creation.\n\n      a.       Product description. The product to be created under the                   series trade name \"Songs 4 Worship\" will be a praise and                   worship continuity series, with each volume in the series                   containing approximately 22 songs. Each volume will be                   manufactured in Double CD, Double Cassette, and song book                   formats, with standard double jewel boxes, inlays, booklets                   and j-cards (the \"Product\"). TL and Integrity will jointly                   develop the repertoire, and all repertoire selections are                   subject to master, mechanical and print rights clearance in                   accordance with the financial terms established below. The                   exact songbook format, song selection and number of songbook                   volumes has not yet been determined, and TL has no obligation                   to sell any songbooks produced pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n      b.

The \"Integrity Music\" and \"Time Life Music\"                   logos will be used on advertising whenever possible, and it is                   understood that neither logo will be used without the other                   with reference to the Product.\n\n      c.       Integrity's responsibilities. Integrity will obtain master                   lease and print agreements with all third party owners of                   masters embodied in the Product at its own expense.

In addition, TL will pay all                   mastering expense required in preparation for manufacturing.\n\n      e.       Shared expenses. The parties agree to share equally in costs                   of additional products created (excluding the Product, and                   song books, which such song books shall be created at                   Integrity's sole discretion and expense), by mutual agreement                   under the \"Songs 4 Worship\" branding.\n\n2.

The parties acknowledge that they cannot control                   the prices set by independent retailers and resellers, but                   agree that sales by the parties hereto via e-commerce will be                   the same, and such will be mutually agreed.\n\n                                    2\n\n5\n\n      d.

For each Annual Report, if the amount in clause (G) of such Annual Report exceeds the amount in clause (F), then Distributor shall pay the amount in clause (H) to Zogenix concurrently with its delivery of such Annual Report to Zogenix. Otherwise, if the amount in clause (G) is less than the amount in clause (F), the amount in clause (H) will be credited against the subsequent payment(s) due from Distributor to Zogenix (or if no further payments will be due, paid by Zogenix to Distributor within [***] after Zogenix's receipt of such Annual Report from Distributor). In no event shall the effective Transfer Price for the Product in a Fiscal Year exceed [***] of the aggregate annual Net Sales of the Product in the Field in the Territory for such Fiscal Year.\n\nARTICLE 7.

Any taxes imposed on Distributor or with respect to Distributor's business operations or activities hereunder, including any value added taxes, consumption, transfer, sales, use or other such taxes relating to the transactions contemplated herein, shall be borne by Distributor, and Distributor shall timely pay, and indemnify and hold harmless, Zogenix from and against all such taxes, including any penalties or interest associated therewith. If Distributor is required by Applicable Law to deduct and withhold taxes from a payment due and payable to Zogenix hereunder (excluding national, state or local taxes based on income to Zogenix), Distributor shall: (a) promptly notify Zogenix of such requirement; (b) make such required deduction and withholding from the corresponding payment; (c) pay to the relevant Governmental Authority the full amount required to be so deducted and withheld; and (d) promptly forward to Zogenix an official receipt or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Zogenix evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority(ies).

Distributor shall keep, and require its Affiliate and Sub-distributors to keep, complete, fair and true books of accounts and records for the purpose of (a) determining the amounts payable to Zogenix pursuant to this Agreement and the Supply Agreement and (b) ensuring that Distributor and its Affiliates and Sub-distributors do not otherwise cause any Zogenix Indemnitees to be in violation of the FCPA or other Applicable Laws. Such books and records shall be kept for such period of time required by Applicable Laws, but no less than three (3) years following the end of the Fiscal Year to which they pertain. Such records shall be subject to inspection in accordance with Section 7.5.\n\n7.5 Audits. Upon reasonable prior written notice, Distributor shall permit an independent, certified public accountant selected by Zogenix and reasonably acceptable to Distributor, which acceptance will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to audit or inspect those books or records of Distributor and its Affiliates and Sub-distributors that relate to Net Sales for the sole purpose of verifying: (a) the payments due hereunder and payments due under the Supply Agreement; (b) the withholding taxes, if any, required by Applicable Laws to be withheld; and (c) Distributor's compliance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2. Such accountant will disclose to Zogenix only the amount and accuracy of payments reported and actually paid or otherwise payable under this Agreement or the Supply Agreement, and will send a copy of the report to Distributor at the same time it is sent to Zogenix. Prompt adjustments (including\n\n28\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\ninterest under Section 7.6 for underpaid amounts) shall be made by the Parties to reflect the results of such audit. Such inspections may be made no more than once each Fiscal Year (unless an audit or inspection reveals a material inaccuracy in reports made under this Agreement, in which case it may be repeated within such Fiscal Year), and during normal business hours, with reasonable efforts to minimize disruption of Distributor's normal business activities. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.5 shall be at the expense of Zogenix, unless a variation or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [***] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period shall be paid by Distributor. Absent manifest error, the accountant's report will be final and binding on the Parties.\n\n7.6 Late Payments. In the event that any payment due under this Agreement or the Supply Agreement is not made when due, the payment shall accrue interest from the date due at a rate per annum equal to [***] above the U.S. Prime Rate (as set forth in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern U.S. Edition) for the date on which payment was due, calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year, or similar reputable data source; provided that in no event shall such rate exceed the maximum legal annual interest rate. The payment of such interest shall not limit a Party from exercising any other rights it may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment.\n\nARTICLE 8. CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n8.1 Confidential Information. Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, the Parties agree that during the Term and for [***] thereafter, the receiving Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall keep confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose or use for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement or the Supply Agreement any Information or materials furnished to it or its Affiliates by or on behalf of the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the Supply Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other written agreement between the Parties or their Affiliates, in any form (written, oral, photographic, electronic, magnetic, or otherwise), including all information concerning the Product and any other technical or business information of whatever nature (collectively, \"Confidential Information\" of the Disclosing Party). All Zogenix Technology (including, without limitation, all Product Inventions and Data) shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Zogenix. Distributor Inventions shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Distributor. Joint Inventions shall be deemed the Confidential Information of each of Zogenix and Distributor. Each Party may use the Confidential Information of the other Party only to the extent required to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement or the Supply Agreement (including to exercise its rights or fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or the Supply Agreement). Each Party will use at least the same standard of care as it uses to protect proprietary or confidential information of its own (but in no event less than reasonable care) to ensure that its employees, agents, consultants and other representatives do not disclose or make any unauthorized use of the\n\n29\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Information of the other Party. Each Party will promptly notify the other upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other Party.\n\n8.2 Exceptions.

In any event, the Parties agree to take all reasonable action to avoid disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder.\n\n8.4 Confidentiality of this Agreement and its Terms. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 8, each Party agrees not to disclose to any Third Party the existence of this Agreement or the terms of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that each Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement that are not otherwise made public as contemplated by Section 8.5 as permitted under Section 8.3.\n\n8.5 Public Announcements.\n\n(a) As soon as practicable following the Effective Date, the Parties may each issue a press release in English and/or Japanese, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 8.5(a), announcing the existence of this Agreement. Except as required by Applicable Laws (including disclosure requirements of the SEC or any stock exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliates are traded), neither Party shall make any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the subject matter hereof without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that each Party may make any public statement in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst calls, or issue press releases, so long as any such public statement or press release is not inconsistent with prior public disclosures or public statements approved by the other Party pursuant to this Section 8.5 and does not reveal non\u2011public information about the other Party; and provided further that Zogenix may make public statements regarding the results of Development and Commercialization activities in the Territory. In the event of a public announcement required by Applicable Laws, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, the Party making such announcement shall provide the other Party with a copy of the proposed text of such announcement sufficiently in advance of the scheduled release to afford such other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed text.\n\n(b) The Parties will coordinate in advance with each other in connection with the filing of this Agreement (including redaction of certain provisions of this Agreement) with the SEC or any stock exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliate are traded, and each Party will use reasonable efforts to seek confidential treatment for the terms proposed to be redacted; provided that each Party will ultimately retain control over what information to disclose to the SEC or other applicable government body, and provided further that the Parties will use their reasonable efforts to file redacted versions with any governing bodies which are consistent with redacted versions previously filed with any other governing bodies. Other than\n\n31\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch obligation, neither Party (nor its Affiliates) will be obligated to consult with or obtain approval from the other Party with respect to any filings to the SEC or any other government body governing a stock exchange.\n\n(c) Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or as required by Applicable Laws, neither Party may use the other Party's trademarks, service marks or trade names, or otherwise refer to or identify that other Party in marketing or promotional materials, press releases, statements to news media or other public announcements, without the other Party's prior written consent, which that other Party may grant or withhold in its sole discretion.\n\n8.6 Publication. At least [***] prior to Distributor or its Affiliates or Sub-distributors publishing, publicly presenting, and/or submitting for written or oral publication a manuscript, presentation, abstract, marketing document or the like that includes Information relating to the Product that has not been previously published, Distributor shall provide to Zogenix's Alliance Manager a draft copy thereof for Zogenix's review (unless Distributor is required by Applicable Laws to publish such Information sooner, in which case Distributor shall provide such draft copy to Zogenix's Alliance Manager as much in advance of such publication as possible). Distributor shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Zogenix during such [***] period, and in the event that Zogenix raises any concerns the matter shall be raised at the JSC; provided that Distributor shall, at Zogenix's reasonable request, cease such proposed publication or remove therefrom any information requested by Zogenix. The contribution of each Party shall be noted in all publications or presentations by acknowledgment or co-authorship, whichever is appropriate.\n\n8.7 Prior Non-Disclosure Agreements. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this Article 8 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, but excluding any terms of the Supply Agreement. Any information disclosed under such prior agreements shall be deemed disclosed under this Agreement.\n\n8.8 Equitable Relief. Given the nature and value of the Confidential Information and the competitive damage and irreparable harm that would result to a Party upon unauthorized disclosure, use or transfer of its Confidential Information to any Third Party, the Parties agree that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Article 8. If the Receiving Party becomes aware of any breach or threatened breach of this Article 8 by the Receiving Party or a Third Party to whom the Receiving Party disclosed the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the Receiving Party promptly shall notify the Disclosing Party and cooperate with the Disclosing Party to regain possession of its Confidential Information and prevent any further breach. In addition to all other remedies, a Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Article 8 without furnishing proof of actual damages or posting a bond.\n\nARTICLE 9.\n\n32\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND ENFORCEMENT\n\n9.1 Ownership of Intellectual Property.\n\n(a) Zogenix Technology.

Zogenix shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to bring and control any action or proceeding with respect to alleged or threatened infringement by a Third Party in the Territory of any Zogenix Patent at Zogenix's cost and expense. If Zogenix elects to commence a suit to enforce the applicable Zogenix Patent against such infringements, then Distributor shall have the right to join such enforcement action, if permitted by Applicable Law, upon notice to Zogenix and be represented by a counsel of its own choice at its own cost and expense.

At any time following the expiration of the Distribution Term, Zogenix may terminate this Agreement at will upon [***] prior written notice to Distributor.\n\n(d) Material Breach.

For all breaches of this Agreement, the allegedly breaching Party shall have [***] from the receipt of the initial notice to cure such breach. If the Party receiving notice of breach fails to cure the breach within such [***] period, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety effective on written notice of termination to the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such material breach (other than a payment breach), by its nature, is curable, but is not reasonably curable within the [***] period, then such period shall be extended if the breaching Party provides a written plan for curing such breach to the non-breaching Party and uses Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cure such breach in accordance with such written plan; provided, that no such extension shall exceed [***] without the consent of the non-breaching Party.\n\n(e) Diligence.

In the event that prior to launch of the Product in the Field in the Territory (i) either Party has a good faith concern that the launch of the Product in the Field in the Territory is not likely to be possible with Commercially Reasonable Efforts, based upon credible evidence, such as any decision by a Regulatory Authority to require significant additional information before granting or as a condition to granting Regulatory Approval, or (ii) Distributor has a good faith concern that the Commercialization of the Product in the Territory will not be commercially viable, such Party may raise such concern for discussion by the JSC. If, within the time periods set forth in Section 3.1(d) or such longer time period as the Parties may mutually agree upon in writing, neither the JSC nor the Executives agree whether to launch or commercialize Product in the Territory, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.1(d) or Article 13, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon at least [***] written notice to the other Party.\n\n(h) Third Party Patent.\n\n(i) Distributor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Zogenix if (A) the Parties have discussed an issued Patent under Section 9.4(a), (B) either (1) both Zogenix and Distributor agree not to seek a license under such issued Patent or (2) the applicable Party as determined pursuant to Section 9.4(a) failed to obtain a license under such issued Patent, after good faith efforts to do so, within [***] after the Parties' agreement as to which Party would seek such license, and (C) Distributor reasonably and in good faith believes that the sale, offer for sale or import of the Product in the Territory in the Field infringes such issued Patent in the Territory, such that Distributor is not able to sell the Product in\n\n43\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Territory in the Field without infringing such issued Patent.\n\n(ii) Zogenix shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Distributor if (A) the Parties have discussed an issued Patent under Section 9.4(a), (B) either (1) both Zogenix and Distributor agree not to seek a license under such issued Patent or (2) the applicable Party as determined pursuant to Section 9.4(a) failed to obtain a license under such issued Patent, after good faith efforts to do so, within [***] after the Parties' agreement as to which Party would seek such license, and (C) Zogenix reasonably and in good faith believes that the manufacture for and sale to Distributor of the Product infringes such issued Patent, such that Zogenix will not be able to conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) such manufacturing for and sale of the Product to Distributor without infringing (or its contract manufacturers infringing) such issued Patent.\n\n(i) Change of Control. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party upon [***] written notice to the other Party in the event that the other Party undergoes a Change of Control; provided, however, that such termination notice shall only be effective if delivered within [***] after the later of the occurrence of such Change of Control or the date the Party undergoing the Change of Control delivers written notice thereof to the other Party.\n\n(j) Other Zogenix Termination Rights.

Following the execution of the Supply Agreement pursuant to Section 5.2, the Parties agree that this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon termination of the Supply Agreement for any reason.\n\n(l) Distributor Safety Concern. This Agreement may be terminated by Distributor upon written notice to Zogenix, in the event that Distributor has a reasonable belief after due inquiry that the promotion of the Product in the Field in the Territory presents a substantial risk of harm or injury to consumers which risk is unacceptable according to established principles of medical ethics. Prior to terminating this Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.2(l), Distributor shall present evidence supporting the basis for such termination to Zogenix and shall consider in good faith all comments provided by Zogenix prior to terminating this Agreement.\n\n44\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3 Rights on Termination.

Method 1.  (a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business  name and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with  specific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member  information, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a  specific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (\"Seeded Profile\"). As of  the date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over  6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an  \"Activated User.\"     (b). In order to activate a Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the  Network, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim the Seeded  Profile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a  user, that user will be deemed to be an \"Activated User\" and the Network will identify that user as an Activated User.     Method 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will be deemed an  Activated User and the Network will identify that user as an \"Activated User.\"     II  Royalty and Initial Bonus     1. Royalty. The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further  described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty  Period during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated  User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users,  respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common  stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of  common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The  form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A-l and shall be referred to as the \"Royalty Warrant.\"\n\n\n\n9\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n   2. Initial Bonus. Concurrent with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to  purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years. The form of warrant is  attached hereto as Schedule A-II and shall be referred to as the \"Bonus Warrant.\"     3. Restrictive Legend. The restricted legend for purposes of any certificate representing the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant, and the stock  certificate for shares underlying the Royalty Warrant or Bonus Warrant is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\") or  any state securities law. These shares have been acquired for investment and may not be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred, nor  will any assignee or transferee thereof be recognized by the Company as having any interest in such shares, in the absence of(i) an effective  registration statement with respect to the shares under the Act, and any other applicable state law, or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to  the Company that such shares will be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred only in a transaction which is exempt under or is  otherwise in compliance with the applicable securities laws.     ***\n\n10\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012"

Accordingly, each Party agrees to take such action as the other Party may reasonably request (including, without limitation, execution of affidavits and other documents) to avoid or curtail the imposition, by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, of any such obligation on such Party or its Affiliates, or the establishment of a nexus for tax purposes sufficient to grant any jurisdiction the authority to levy any sales tax, use tax or similar tax on sales of products by such Party or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 11.1.1  [Tax Treatment] shall limit Company's obligations under Section 11.1.2  [Tax Treatment].\n\n              11.1.2  Company will collect and pay, and indemnify and hold harmless ACSI and its Affiliates from, any sales, use, excise, import or export, value added or similar tax or duty not based on ACSI's or its Affiliates' net income, including penalties and interest, costs associated with the collection and withholding thereof and attorneys fees in connection therewith, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or Company's advertisement, offer or sale of any products.\n\n     11.2     Insurance.

Each Party will protect the Confidential Information of the other Party from misappropriation and unauthorized use or disclosure, and at a minimum, will take precautions at least as great as those taken to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event with less than reasonable care.

This provision shall not be construed to conflict with the provisions of the Section entitled \"Mediation/Arbitration.\"    Proprietary to Bank of America  Page 27  vTIP2010\n\nSource: CARDLYTICS, INC., S-1, 1/12/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n36.0 DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n36.1 The following procedure will be adhered to in all disputes arising under this Agreement which the Parties cannot resolve informally through their Relationship Managers. The aggrieved Party shall notify the other Party in writing of the nature of the dispute with as much detail as possible about the deficient performance of the other Party. The Relationship Managers shall meet (in person or by telephone) within seven (7) calendar days (or other mutually agreed upon date) after the date of the written notification to reach an agreement about the nature of the deficiency and the corrective action to be taken by the respective Parties. If the Relationship Managers do not meet or are unable to agree on corrective action, senior managers of the Parties having authority to resolve the dispute without the further consent of any other person (\"Management\") shall meet or otherwise act to facilitate an agreement within fourteen (14) calendar days (or other mutually agreed upon date) of the date of the written notification. If Management do not meet or cannot resolve the dispute or agree upon a written plan of corrective action to do so within seven (7) calendar days (or other mutually agreed upon date) after their initial meeting or other action, or if the agreed-upon completion dates in the written plan of corrective action are exceeded, either Party may request mediation and/or arbitration as provided for in this Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically provided, neither Party shall initiate arbitration, mediation or litigation unless and until this dispute resolution procedure has been substantially compiled with or waived. Failure of a Party to fulfill its obligations in this Section, including failure to meet timely upon the other Party's notice, shall be deemed such a waiver.\n\n  37.0 MEDIATION/ARBITRATION\n\n37.1 If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement in accordance with the Section entitled \"Dispute Resolution,\" the Parties will in good faith attempt to resolve such dispute through non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be conducted before a mediator acceptable to both sides, who shall be an attorney or retired judge practicing in the areas of banking and/or information technology law. The mediation shall be held In Charlotte, N.C., provided, however, a dispute relating to infringement of Intellectual Property Rights or the Section entitled \"Confidentiality and Information Protection\" shall not be subject to this Section entitled \"Mediation/Arbitration.\"\n\n37.2 Any controversy or claim, other than those specifically excluded, between or among the Parties not resolved through mediation under the preceding provision, shall at the request of a Party be determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by one independent arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge practicing in the areas of banking and/or Information technology law. The arbitration shall be held in Charlotte, N.C. in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), notwithstanding any choice of law provision in this Agreement, and under the auspices and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\n\n37.3 Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each Party will, upon the written request of the other Party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim or counterclaim on which the producing Party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. At the request of a Party, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to order examination by deposition of witnesses to the extent the arbitrator deems such additional discovery relevant and appropriate. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three (3) per Party and shall be held within thirty (30) calendar days of the making of a request. Additional depositions may be scheduled only with the permission of the arbitrator, and for good cause shown. Each deposition shall be limited to a maximum of three (3) hours duration. All objections are reserved for the arbitration hearing except for objections based on privilege and proprietary or confidential information. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the arbitrator, which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed within sixty (60) calendar days following the appointment of the arbitrator.

The arbitrator shall follow the law in reaching a reasoned decision and shall deliver a written opinion setting forth findings of fact, conclusions of law and the rationale for the decision. The arbitrator shall reconsider the decision once upon the motion and at the expense of a Party. The Section of this Agreement entitled \"Confidentiality and Information Protection\" shall apply to the arbitration proceeding, all evidence taken, and the arbitrator's opinion, which shall be Confidential Information of both Parties. Judgment upon the decision rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n\n37.5 No provision of this Section shall limit the right of a Party to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction before, after, or during the pendency of any arbitration. The exercise of a remedy does not waive the right of either Party to resort to arbitration. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of either Party to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if the other Party contests such action for judicial relief.\n\n  38.0 NON-EXCLUSIVE NATURE OF AGREEMENT\n\n38.1 Supplier agrees that it shall not be considered Bank of America's exclusive provider of any goods or services provided hereunder.
